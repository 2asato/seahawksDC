2019 SEAHAWKS DRAFT CLASS

Built with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and Javascript, this single page, fully responsive app that introduces the Seattle Seahawks latest draft class.  

Each player section includes an image, quotes describing the player as well as links to their social media pages, nfl.com draft profile page and a youtube highlight video.  Some of the videos don't work and I am still searching for videos I am able to use.
